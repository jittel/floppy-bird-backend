## Installation
Before installing, please make sure you have node.js installed locally. If you don't already have node.js, you can download it via their [website](https://nodejs.dev/). After cloning this repo, open the integrated terminal in VS Code & install the necessary npm packages. A package.json file already exists with listed dependencies, so you can simply enter "npm install" to acquire the required packages. You'll need to create a .env file with the database name, user, password, & jwt secret. Then, in your terminal, enter "npm run resetdb" to reset the database. Enter your MySQL password when prompted. Then, enter "npm run seed" to seed the database. Finally, enter "npm start" to run the server.

## Usage
On the front end, users begin by creating an account & naming their chicken. Once logged in, the user is brought to the homepage. Here, the user can feed their chicken & see their egg count rise. The user can then purchase various accessories for their chicken using eggs as currency. The button on the left side of the header opens the store. When the user selects a category, a nested list will expand to display the various accessories they can purchase for their chicken. Once an accessory is purchased, it will populate in their accessory inventory. The button on the right side of the header opens the user's inventory. Here, the user can click on any accessory to put it on their chicken.
